Data science projects.

# 1) 

The first project is an analysis of celebrity deaths from 2006-2016. In this analysis we are trying to answer the following questions. Note that this is a work in progress.

1) Have celebrity deaths increased from 2006 to 2016?

2) What are the main reasons for celebrity deaths?

3) What is the age around which we see most number of celebrity deaths?

4) Which countries see most number of celeberity deaths caused by the main reasons identified.

5) What are the numbers in 2016?

6) How do the death rates change in America? What happens in 2016 and also how it changes from 2006 to 2016?

7) What kind of celebrities are most affected by these main reasons?



# 2)

The second project is an analysis of indian water quality over years 2009 through 2012 in different state and district level.We have selected four states namely Bihar, Bengal, Rajasthan and Karnataka after a preliminary assessment from a barplot to analyze the water quality paramters in those states.The files are in india_water.zip which includes indian_water.ipynb and the data file is India_water.csv.zip .





# 3) 

The third project which is still a work in progress is in coversion_challenge.zip which includes files conversion_data.csv and first_challenge.ipynb. This project includes batch processing due to large dataset to train a logistic regression and SVM model. Very interesting. More explanations to follow. So far the prediction scores are pretty satisfactory.


# 4)

The fourth project is related to credit card fraud detection (**fraud_detection.ipynb**).The dataset is too big to load.The interesting thing about the dataset is that it is imbalanced so I did undersampling as a solution. The data could be undersampled more since the fraud data is very less. I used logistic regression for this dataset for prediction of fraud and non-fraud.
